1. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

Clothing and Electronics inherit common properties and methods from the Product class, such as id, name, price, and calculateDiscount().

2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is keeping data safe within a class by using private fields and providing public methods to access or modify them.

The size field is private and can only be accessed or changed through getSize() and setSize() methods.

3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows the same method to work differently in different classes.

calculateDiscount() is overridden in Clothing and Electronics classes to give different discounts:
Clothing gives a 30% discount.
Electronics gives a 20% discount.

4. Abstraction
Abstraction hides complex details and only shows what is necessary.
